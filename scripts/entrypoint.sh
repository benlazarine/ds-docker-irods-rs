#! /bin/bash
#
# Usage:
#  entrypoint [CMD]...
#
# Parameters:
#  CMD  One or more terms in the command to execute once the container is ready.
#
# This is the container entrypoint program. It finalizes the resource server
# configuration with the container information so that the resource server can
# interoperate with the other iRODS grid nodes. The resource server is not
# started though.
#
# If a command is provided to this program, it will be executed as the
# appropriate user after the configuration has been updated. Otherwise, a bash
# shell will be entered into.
#
# This script expects the following environment variables to be defined.
#
# CYVERSE_DS_CLERVER_PASSWORD   the password used to authenticate the clerver
#                               user with the IES.
# CYVERSE_DS_CONTROL_PLANE_KEY  the encryption key required for communicating
#                               over the relevant iRODS grid control plane
# CYVERSE_DS_NEGOTIATION_KEY    the encryption key shared by the iplant zone for
#                               advanced negotiation during client connections
# CYVERSE_DS_ZONE_KEY           the shared secret used during server-to-server
#                               communication
